<h1>Jack Korba SWEN 101</h1>
<p>
  
  I attended Hempfield High School in Landisville, Pennsylvania.
  I live in Lancaster county, and I have had an internship at the software development company
  Seisan Consulting during my senior year and this past summer. I was an active member of Scouts
  BSA, and I have achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. I also have played Ice Hockey for the Lancaster
  Firebirds, and I am a fan of the NY Rangers.
